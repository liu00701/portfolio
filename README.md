In this project, I used a design-first method. I started with a reference image and built the layout using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main structure was easy to create, but I ran into some problems during the process:

## Carousel Layout

At first, I used the default Bootstrap carousel. But it didn’t work the way I wanted — the image showed under the text, but I wanted them to be separate. I searched online for solutions and changed the layout to fit my design better.

## Button Animation Problem

I added a pulse animation to the button when the mouse hovers over it. But I found another animation appeared when the mouse moved away. To fix this, I searched for answers online and wrote a small JavaScript code to remove the animation class after the page loaded. This solved the problem.

## Deadline Mistake

One big problem I faced was getting the deadline wrong. I thought I had more time, but I realized too late that the deadline was sooner. Because of this, I had to rush and couldn’t finish everything as well as I wanted. This taught me an important lesson — I need to plan better, especially for things like content and different image sizes.

## What I Learned

- Customizing pre-made components for my own design
